    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Meep560, or just Meep and I do things sometimes. This is my website. You could look around it if you'd like to know a bit more about me. Under here there's some buttons that will link you to pages which talk about the music and games that I like.</p>
    <p>I would generally consider myself a chill and helpful person, and if you ever need somebody to talk to you can come to talk to me, I’m probably one of the least judgmental people. </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include music, sound engineering, and playing video games, but I also get out from time to time to play some airsoft as well. I’m also interested in a lot of the Nordic countries (except Denmark, Denmark sucks) but more specifically Sweden. I can speak the Swedish language and would like to know as much as I can about their history. </p>
    <p>I also really like physical media like blu-rays, vinyl and CDs. I also spend way too much time at my local library so you could probably find me hanging out there most days. That’s pretty much everything I think except for the stuff that I’ve deemed important enough to have their own pages. Have fun exploring!</p>

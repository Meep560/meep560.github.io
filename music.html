    <h1>Artists I like</h1>
    <img src="artistnf.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist NF" class="art">
    <h2>NF</h2>
    <p>NF is honestly my favorite musician and my idol just because of what he does. He sings about how he feels and doesn’t let anybody stop him. Because life isn’t perfect and life is really hard, and he isn’t afraid to admit it or speak his mind about what he believes in. Also the beats for his rap music are just really really good.</p>
    <img src="artistelyotto.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist ElyOtto" class="art">
    <h2>ElyOtto</h2>
    <p>ElyOtto honestly makes the textbook definition of hyperpop (if there is one) but does it in a way in which the pop part doesn’t annoy me, because I don’t like most pop music, but it’s nice to sit back with some good hyperpop without the pop element annoying me.</p>
    <img src="artist100gecs.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist 100 Gecs" class="art">
    <h2>100 Gecs</h2>
    <p>100 Gecs is a great hyperpop group, but they also make a lot of really weird genre bending music. Mixing everything from rock to country their music is really weird, but really good.</p>
    <img src="artistconfetti.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist Confetti" class="art">
    <h2>Confetti</h2>
    <p>Confetti, the band made up of Conrad and Fetti, is the very definition of non-conformity. They make amazing music. They know they’re different and they make sure to never lose what makes them so great. If there’s one artist, I’d recommend to the average person it would be Confetti.</p>
    <img src="artistajr.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist AJR" class="art">
    <h2>AJR</h2>
    <p>You probably already know AJR, I think everybody does, but if you don’t know the name, you’ll know their music as they’re the people behind The World’s Smallest Violin, Bang!, and Yes, I’m a Mess. I love how unique their music is, and they just have their own unique style that sounds great.</p>
    <img src="artistcuco.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist Cuco" class="art">
    <h2>Cuco</h2>
    <p>Cuco just makes really weird music in general. It’s really slow and generally electronic, but not how you would imagine normal electronic music. It’s really weird to describe, but it’s good. He has a few too many romance songs, but hey I listen to him for the beats not the lyrics. The reason I don’t listen to him for the lyrics is partially because quite a bit of them are in Spanish and I don’t know Spanish. Regardless, he makes good music.</p>
    <img src="artistglorb.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist Glorb" class="art">
    <h2>Glorb</h2>
    <p>Glorb makes rap with the cast from SpongeBob with amazing beats. That’s really it, nobody knows who Glorb really is.</p>
    <img src="artistc418.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist C418" class="art">
    <h2>C418</h2>
    <p>Yeah, ok sure, he made the music for Minecraft, but I honestly prefer his work outside of Minecraft. You know when he made what he wanted to make, and it didn’t need to fit into or make sense in a video game and he got a lot better at making music as time progressed after he quit making Minecraft’s music. </p>
    <img src="artistlegrand.png" alt="A profile photo for the musical artist LeGrand" class="art">
    <h2>LeGrand</h2>
    <p>He makes what I can only describe as neojazz. It’s really soft and honestly really good even though that’s not normally the type of music I like. He just finds a way to make it work. The sound is also unique in a great way.</p>

    <h1>Albums I like</h1>
    <img src="albumthesearch.png" alt="Album art for the album The Search" class="art">
    <h2>The Search</h2>
    <h3>By NF</h3>
    <p>This is probably one of NF’s most emotional albums and it’s the one that I’d recommend to people who haven’t listened to NF’s music to start with. I thought of including the album the album before this one on the list but honestly as NF has gotten better with more practice making this album far surpass the one before it, and I don’t want to list ever single NF album, but Perception is also a great album.</p>
    <img src="albumcloudsthemixtape.png" alt="Album art for the album CLOUDS (THE MIXTAPE)" class="art">
    <h2>CLOUDS (THE MIXTAPE)</h2>
    <h3>By NF</h3>
    <p>NF’s most experimental album and I love it because of that. NF’s music sounds more repetitive than other artists, so the change of pace is great, and I honestly think the album is really underrated.</p>
    <img src="albumhope.png" alt="Album art for the album HOPE" class="art">
    <h2>HOPE</h2>
    <h3>By NF</h3>
    <p>NF’s new album and it’s pretty good. I’m glad that he seems like mentally he’s in a better which spot, so recently has produced a little happier music in this album which if never a bad thing, but it makes it different from other albums.</p>
    <img src="albumhellscapesuburbia.png" alt="Album art for the album HELLSCAPE SUBURBIA" class="art">
    <h2>HELLSCAPE SUBURBIA</h2>
    <h3>By ElyOtto</h3>
    <p>HELLSCAPE SUBURBIA is ElyOtto’s most hyperpopy album, so while other albums like Happy Together Convenience Store are good, they don’t have as much hyperpop, so I listen to HELLSCAPE SUBURBIA more.</p>
    <img src="album10000gecs.png" alt="Album art for the album 10,000 gecs" class="art">
    <h2>10,000 gecs</h2>
    <h3>By 100 gecs</h3>
    <p>10,000 gecs is newest album from 100 Gecs and it’s really good, seeing as it’s just standard them, but improved from their previous stuff because when you practice a skill, you get better at it.</p>
    <img src="albumthemaybeman.png" alt="Album art for the album The Maybe Man" class="art">
    <h2>The Maybe Man</h2>
    <h3>by AJR</h3>
    <p>AJR’s newest album and it’s pretty good. It’s pretty standard album from them so it’s pretty good and I don’t have too much to add here.</p>
    <img src="albumokorchestra.png" alt="Album art for the album OK ORCHESTRA" class="art">
    <h2>OK ORCHESTRA</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>This might objectively be the best AJR album giving us bangers like Bang!, and World’s Smallest Violin. It is the one I listen to the least though just because since those two songs are way too overplayed so I don’t want to hear them as much, but the rest of the album is absolutely amazing.</p>
    <img src="albumneotheater.png" alt="Album art for the album Neotheater" class="art">
    <h2>Neotheater</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>Probably my most listened to AJR album just because The Maybe Man is new and OK ORCHESTRA has two really overplayed songs. Also look at the clouds on the album art. They look like cotton candy, and I want to eat them really badly. Anyways, great album overall.</p>
    <img src="albumtheclickdeluxeedition.png" alt="Album art for the album The Click (Deluxe Edition)" class="art">
    <h2>The Click (Deluxe Edition)</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>Probbaly AJR’s most underrated album because it’s one of their oldest, but it still has some amazing  music and is a must listen for any person that calls themselves and AJR fan.</p>
    <img src="albumactiicircusofthesky.png" alt="Album art for the album Act II: Circus Of The Sky" class="art">
    <h2>Act II: Circus Of The Sky</h2>
    <h3>By Confetti</h3>
    <p>Unlike their first album (which was still really good), Confetti really knew their style and how to lean into it, making it a great album.</p>
    <img src="albumfantasygateway.png" alt="Album art for the album Fantasy Gateway" class="art">
    <h2>Fantasy Gateway</h2>
    <h3>By Cuco</h3>
    <p>Cuco’s newest album and by far his best. It really feels like the fantasy gateway when listening to it which feels like a really chill acid trip. I feel like the music video for Caution would describe the feeling the best, but yeah, overall great album.</p>
    <img src="albumexcursions.png" alt="Album art for the album Excursions" class="art">
    <h2>Excurions</h2>
    <h3>By C418</h3>
    <p>C418’s latest solo project and it’s my favorite album by him. It’s very different from his Minecraft stuff with album being very eclectic, but still very C418.</p>
    <img src="albumok.png" alt="Album art for the album okay" class="art">
    <h2>okay</h2>
    <h3>By LeGrand</h3>
    <p>LeGrand’s only album and it’s pretty good. With how much he’s improved with his recent singles I’ll be waiting for his next album because with how good this one was it has to be quite a bit better with how much he’s improved over the years.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Singels I like</h1>
    <img src="singleboring.png" alt="The art for the single Boring" class="art">
    <h2>Boring</h2>
    <h3>By Confetti</h3>
    <p>Boring is honestly my favorite single by confetti, it’s so good and very underrated. I honestly don’t understand how it’s popularity doesn’t reach the likes of other songs like Guilty Pleasures that were released at the same time.</p>
    <img src="singleballoons.png" alt="The art for the EP Balloons" class="art">
    <h2>Balloons</h2>
    <h3>By Confetti</h3>
    <p>While Balloons is technically an EP, most of the songs in it were released as singles first, like No Strings and Doses. So, I’m counting the song Balloons as a single. Anyways pretty good song, and it also has a pretty good music video as well.</p>
    <img src="singlenoname.png" alt="The art for the single NO NAME" class="art">
    <h2>NO NAME</h2>
    <h3>By NF</h3>
    <p>Really NF’s only single and he hit it out of the park. The melody is awesome and very energetic which helps if that’s what I want to listen to, because not all of his music is energetic.</p>
    <img src="singleteeth!.png" alt="The art for the single TEETH!" class="art">
    <h2>TEETH!</h2>
    <h3>By ElyOtto</h3>
    <p>The background for this website is actually this song put through a spectralizer. The song is pretty short and sweet and pretty good. I thought of including some of ElyOtto’s newer singles but decided against it for different reasons relating to each single. They’re still pretty good if you like ElyOtto though.</p>
    <img src="singlesugarcrash.png" alt="The art for the single SugarCrash!" class="art">
    <h2>SugarCrash!</h2>
    <h3>By ElyOtto</h3>
    <p>ElyOtto’s claim to fame. The song being short and sweet is incredible. It’s a bit sad though how he’s just known as the SugarCrash! person and not for any of his other music which is sad because I think some songs like Dishes are better, but SugarCrash! Is always going to be his most famous song.</p>
    <img src="singlewhenthedaycomestoanenddjsliinkremix.png" alt="The art for the single When The Day Comes To An End (DJ Sliink remix)" class="art">
    <h2>When The Day Comes To An End (DJ Sliink remix)</h2>
    <h3>By Cuco</h3>
    <p>There’s not too much for me to say other than it’s a  great remix for an already incredible song.</p>
    <img src="singlemhmm.png" alt="The art for the single MHMM" class="art">
    <h2>MHMM</h2>
    <h3>By Glorb</h3>
    <p>Literally just ”Sandy Thee Squirl” rapping about money, drugs, and guns. There’s not too much to it. It’s also probably my favorite song from Glorb.</p>
    <img src="singlerecordplayer.png" alt="The art for the single Record Player" class="art">
    <h2>Record Player</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>Pretty good song it’s very chill, and sometimes maybe all we’re doing is trying to convince ourselves that we’re alive.</p>
    <img src="singlebangahhhaaremix.png" alt="The art for the single Bang! (feat. Heyley Kiyoko) [AhhHaa Remix]" class="art">
    <h2>Bang! (feat. Heyley Kiyoko) [AhhHaa Remix]</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>Great remix for an overplayed (but good) song. Bang! is so overplayed and this remix helps if feel fresh again and since it’s for Bang! which is already done well it just pushes the success of the remix. Honestly this is probably the best remix I’ve ever seen done staying so true to the original song and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>
    <img src="singleletthegamesbegin.png" alt="The art for the single Let the Games Begin" class="art">
    <h2>Let the Games Begin</h2>
    <h3>By AJR</h3>
    <p>One of AJR’s best singles and it’s extremely underrated because it was made before they got really popular, but it still absolutely slaps. If you like AJR you should listen to Let the Games Begin.</p>
    <img src="singlegivealittle.png" alt="The art for the single Give a Little" class="art">
    <h2>Give a Little</h2>
    <h3>By LeGrand</h3>
    <p>One of LeGrand’s best songs. I honestly like the version featuring CG5 the best, just because the tune jumps around a little less and it adds more lyrics that make the song better. The beat is also just really good.</p>
    <img src="singleplaypretenses.png" alt="The art for the single play pretenses" class="art">
    <h2>play pretenses</h2>
    <h3>By LeGrand</h3>
    <p>Great song, with a very unique beat. The lyrics go well with the beat and actually have an effect on the beat referencing it in the lyrics.</p>
    <img src="singlerunlittlehero.png" alt="The art for the single run little hero" class="art">
    <h2>run little hero</h2>
    <h3>By LeGrand</h3>
    <p>Good and very relatable song (at least for me.) The ending of it hits especially hard.</p>
